+title: Weave Cloud Service Broker for PCF
+owner: Partners
+---
+
+This documentation describes the Weave Cloud Service Broker for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) tile. Installing this tile
+creates a service that enables operators and app developers to track all system and application metrics
+from their PCF installation in one place.
+
+## <a id='overview'></a>Overview
+
+Weave Cloud is an ops platform that provide one-click ops for development teams. Weave Cloud Service Broker for PCF provide multi-teanant monitoring and exploring service 
+
+The tile comes with pre-built integration with the following services available as PCF tiles:
+
+- [Weave Cloud Service Broker for PCF](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-weave)
+
+This integration enables operators to monitor these services without any additional configuration.
+
+The tile comes with pre-built integration with the following externally deployed services:
+
+- Weave Cloud - Deploy, Explore, Monitor
+
+Weave Cloud Service Broker for PCF requires additional configuration to monitor these services.
+
+## <a id='features'></a>Key Features
+
+Weave Cloud Service Broker for PCF includes the following key features:
+
+* **PCF monitoring**: Collects metrics emitted by all components of PCF
+* **IaaS-level monitoring**: Collects metrics from CPU, memory usage, IO, network, VM states, and more, regardless of the underlying infrastructure
+* **Third-party services monitoring**: Provides the ability to collect metrics from MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, and RabbitMQ
+* **Application monitoring**: Gathers standard metrics (CPU, memory, or disk usage), arbitrary metrics (gauges, counters, timings, sets),
+  and HTTP-specific metrics (requests per second, status codes, error rates, and more)
+* **SSO and multi-tenancy**: Uses the Cloud Foundry UAA service
+  to control access to apps and resources based on user roles and rights within the platform.
+  Multi-tenancy is implemented according to Cloud Foundry UAA roles.
+  Dedicated shares of the solution are deployed to different spaces to collect metrics from the apps and services running within.
+* **Alerts**: Can be defined for each dashboard panel, and allow users to get immediate notifications though email, Slack, and other notification channels.

+
+## <a id="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites
+
+To complete installation of Weave Cloud Service Broker for PCF, you need the following:
+
+* An AWS S3 bucket or WebDAV with credentials to store alert images from Grafana
+* Alert notification endpoint (SMTP server for email notifications, Slack, Sensu) with credentials
+* CPU, RAM, and disk resources for seven VMs
+* Internet connectivity between the networks where the PCF deployment and Heartbeat are installed.
+  Altoros recommends installing Heartbeat on the same network with PCF.
+* TCP 2003 and 8126, and UDP 8125 ports open in the firewall to accept connections from PCF and services networks. Ports 2003 and 8125 are used to receive metrics. TCP 8126 is necessary for Load Balancer health checks.
+
+## <a id="reqs"></a>Requirements
+
+Weave Cloud Service Broker for PCF has the following requirements:
+
+* [Elastic Runtime](https://network.pivotal.io/products/elastic-runtime) v1.10.x, v1.11.x
+* [Ops Manager](https://network.pivotal.io/products/ops-manager) v1.10.x, v1.11.x
+* Installation of the collectd add-on for PCF to enable PCF component VMs and
+  the VMs of any other BOSH-deployed services expose system metrics to Heartbeat.
+For more information, see [Installing collectd Add-on for PCF](installing.html).
+* (Optional) If you want to enable collection of JMX metrics from Java apps, you will need a custom Java buildpack for Weave Cloud Service Broker for PCF.
+For more information, see [JMXTrans Agent Integration](jmxtrans.html).
+* (Optional) If you want to enable collection of custom application metrics, you must integrate a StatsD library into the app's code.
+  For more information, see [StatsD Integration](statsd.html).
+
+## <a id="limitations"></a>Limitations
+
+The Weave Cloud Service Broker for PCF tile has the following limitations:
+
+* Offline buildpack for collecting JMX metrics is unavailable. Only the online version of the buildpack from
+  [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/Altoros/java-buildpack#jmx-agent-integration) can be used to collect JMX metrics from Java apps.
+* Users are limited to using internal MariaDB to store internal Heartbeat data such as user sessions, mappings, dashboards, UI configs, etc.
+* Downscaling with retained high availability is only possible to at least two back-end instances.
